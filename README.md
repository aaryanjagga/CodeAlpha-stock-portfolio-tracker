Task 2 – CodeAlpha Python Internship
# Stock Portfolio Tracker


This is my second task for the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.
I had to create a simple **Stock Portfolio Tracker** in Python that lets the user enter stock names and quantities, calculates the total value based on fixed prices, and saves the results if needed.

# What this project does

* Lets you type stock names like **AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT**
* Uses a predefined dictionary of prices
* Asks you how many shares you want
* Calculates the value of each stock
* Shows the total investment
* Optionally saves everything to a text file

Simple, beginner-friendly, and straight to the point.



# Things I learned

* Using dictionaries
* Handling user input
* Loops and conditions
* Basic calculations
* Writing to files in Python

This task helped me understand how real-life tools like portfolio calculators actually work.

 How to run the project

Just run:
# Example output
AAPL x 3 = $540
TSLA x 1 = $250
Total = $790
If you choose to save, a file named portfolio.txt will be created.
